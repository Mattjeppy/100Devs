//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let newArr = ['Star Wars', 'Harry Potter', 'Independence Day']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = newArr[0]
 
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrayLength = newArr.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. 
// What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? 
// Would your solution still work?
